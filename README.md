# PZ_Immunity
This is the repository for my Project Zomboid Immunity Mod.

[**Steam Workshop Page**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3396429342)

This mod aims to make the time between getting bitten or scratched and the potential zombification way more tense and uncertain. Instead of outright immunity or guaranteed infection, this mod focuses on keeping you guessing and adds layers of suspense to the experience.

## Concept

- **Dynamic Immunity System**  
  Every character starts with a base chance of immunity to the virus.

- **Building Immunity Over Time**  
  For every scratch that doesn't infect you, your immunity slightly improves. However, immunity can weaken over time if you're not exposed to new challenges.

- **Fake Infections**  
  Even if you're immune, your body can react to the bite or scratch with symptoms that feel like the real deal—fever, nausea, etc. You won't know for sure if you're in the clear until the symptoms fade... or you turn.

---

## Compatibility

This mod should work fine with any other mods that do not alter infection mechanics or reduce limb counts (though it might still work in some cases).  

**Safe to enable or remove the mod mid-save.**

## Upcoming Features

I'm currently expanding the functionality of this mod to include the following:

- Blood types affecting immunity and healing.  
- Severity levels for bites and scratches.  
- Permanent damage caused by immune reactions (because surviving comes with scars).  
- Immunity with a cost—your body takes a toll from fighting off the virus, potentially leaving you with lasting damage.  
- Diet and nutrition affecting how well your character's immune system functions.
